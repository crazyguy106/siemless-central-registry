  pattern: MAC MAC_address moved from interface_1 to interface_2 Explanation A host
    move was detected from one module interface to another. In a transparent Secure
    Firewall ASA, mapping between the host (MAC) and Secure Firewall ASA port is maintained
    in a Layer 2 forwarding table. The table dynamically binds packet source MAC addresses
    to an Secure Firewall ASA port. In this process, whenever movement of a host from
    one interface to another interface is detected, this message is generated. Recommended
    Action The host move might be valid or might be an attempt to spoof host MACs
    on other interfaces. If it is a MAC spoof attempt, you can either locate vulnerable
    hosts on your network and remove them or configure static MAC entries, which will
    not allow MAC address and port binding to change. If it is a genuine host move,
    no action is required.

  pattern: Maximum concurrent IKE negotiations exceeded! Explanation To minimize CPU-intensive
    cryptographic calculations, the Secure Firewall ASA limits the number of connection
    negotiations in progress. When a new negotiation is requested and the Secure Firewall

    connection negotiation completes, new connection negotiation will again be permitted.
    Recommended Action See the crypto ikev1 limit max-in-negotiation-sa command. Increasing
    the limit can degrade performance..
