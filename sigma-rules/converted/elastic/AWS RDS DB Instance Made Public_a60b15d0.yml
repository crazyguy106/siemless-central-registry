description: Identifies the creation or modification of an AWS RDS DB instance to
  enable public access. DB instances may contain sensitive data that can be abused
  if shared with unauthorized accounts or made public. Adversaries may enable public
  access on a DB instance to maintain persistence or evade defenses by bypassing access
  controls.
