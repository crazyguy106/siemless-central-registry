title: AWS CloudTrail Log Updated
id: 3e002465-876f-4f04-b016-84ef48ce7e5d
status: stable
level: low
description: 'Detects updates to an existing CloudTrail trail via UpdateTrail API
  which may reduce visibility, change destinations, or

  weaken integrity (e.g., removing global events, moving the S3 destination, or disabling
  validation). Adversaries can

  modify trails to evade detection while maintaining a semblance of logging. Validate
  any configuration change against

  approved baselines.'

- "    Trail updates may be made by a system or network administrator. Verify whether\
  \ the user identity, user agent, and/or\n    hostname should be making changes in\
  \ your environment. Trail updates from unfamiliar users or hosts should be\n   \
  \ investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted\
  \ from the rule.\n    "
