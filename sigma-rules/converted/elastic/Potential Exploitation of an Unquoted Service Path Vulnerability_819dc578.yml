title: Potential Exploitation of an Unquoted Service Path Vulnerability
id: 12de29d4-bbb0-4eef-b687-857e8a163870
status: stable
level: low
description: 'Adversaries may leverage unquoted service path vulnerabilities to escalate
  privileges. By placing an executable in a

  higher-level directory within the path of an unquoted service executable, Windows
  will natively launch this executable

  from its defined path variable instead of the benign one in a deeper directory,
  thus leading to code execution.'
