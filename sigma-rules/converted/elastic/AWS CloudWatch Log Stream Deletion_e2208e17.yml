- "    A log stream may be deleted by a system administrator. Verify whether the user\
  \ identity, user agent, and/or hostname\n    should be making changes in your environment.\
  \ Log stream deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should be\n    investigated.\
  \ If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.\n\
