title: RPC (Remote Procedure Call) from the Internet
id: 143cb236-0956-4f42-a706-814bcaa0cf5a
status: stable
level: high
description: 'This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RPC traffic
  from the Internet. RPC is commonly used by

  system administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared
  resources. It should almost never be

  directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by
  threat actors as an initial access or

  backdoor vector.'
