description: 'Identifies the occurence of files uploaded to SharePoint being detected
  as Malware by the file scanning engine.

  Attackers can use File Sharing and Organization Repositories to spread laterally
  within the company and amplify their

  access. Users can inadvertently share these files without knowing their maliciousness,
  giving adversaries opportunities

  to gain initial access to other endpoints in the environment.'
