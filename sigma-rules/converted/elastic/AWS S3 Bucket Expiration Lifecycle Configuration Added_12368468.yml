title: AWS S3 Bucket Expiration Lifecycle Configuration Added
id: ff320c56-f8fa-11ee-8c44-f661ea17fbce
status: stable
level: low
description: 'Identifies the addition of an expiration lifecycle configuration to
  an Amazon S3 bucket. S3 lifecycle rules can

  automatically delete or transition objects after a defined period. Adversaries can
  abuse them by configuring

  auto-deletion of logs, forensic evidence, or sensitive objects to cover their tracks.
  This rule detects the use of the

  PutBucketLifecycle or PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration APIs with Expiration parameters,
  which may indicate an attempt to

  automate the removal of data to hinder investigation or maintain operational secrecy
  after malicious activity.'
