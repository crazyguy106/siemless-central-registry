id: d788313c-9e0b-4c5a-8c4b-c3f05a47d5a8
status: stable
level: low
description: 'This rule detects the creation and modification of sitecustomize.py
  and usercustomize.py, which

  Python automatically executes on startup. Attackers can exploit these files for
  persistence by

  injecting malicious code. The rule monitors system-wide, user-specific, and virtual
  environment

  locations to catch unauthorized changes that could indicate persistence or backdooring
  attempts.'
