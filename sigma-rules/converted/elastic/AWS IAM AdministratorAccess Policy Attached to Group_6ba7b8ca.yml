status: stable
level: medium
description: 'An adversary with access to a set of compromised credentials may attempt
  to persist or escalate privileges by attaching

  additional permissions to user groups the compromised user account belongs to. This
  rule looks for use of the IAM

  AttachGroupPolicy API operation to attach the highly permissive AdministratorAccess
  AWS managed policy to an existing

  IAM user group.'
