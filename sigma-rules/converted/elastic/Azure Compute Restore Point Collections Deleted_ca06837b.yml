status: stable
level: high
description: 'Identifies multiple Azure Restore Point Collections being deleted by
  a single user within a short time period. Restore

  Point Collections contain recovery points for virtual machines, enabling point-in-time
  recovery capabilities. Mass

  deletion of these collections is a common tactic used by adversaries during ransomware
  attacks to prevent victim

  recovery or to maximize impact during destructive operations. Multiple deletions
  in rapid succession may indicate

  malicious intent.'
