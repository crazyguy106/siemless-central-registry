title: AWS IAM Login Profile Added for Root
id: c04be7e0-b0fc-11ef-a826-f661ea17fbce
status: stable
level: high
description: Identifies creation of a console login profile for the AWS account root
  user. While CreateLoginProfile normally applies to IAM users, when performed from
  a temporary root session (e.g., via AssumeRoot) and the userName parameter is omitted,
  the profile is created for the root principal (self-assigned). Adversaries with
  temporary root access may add or reset the root login profile to establish persistent
  console access even if original access keys are rotated or disabled. Correlate with
  recent AssumeRoot/STS activity and validate intent with the account owner.
