title: Potential CVE-2025-41244 vmtoolsd LPE Exploitation Attempt
id: c5da2519-160c-4cc9-bf69-b0223e99d0db
status: stable
level: medium
description: 'This rule looks for processes that behave like an attacker trying to
  exploit a known vulnerability in VMware tools (CVE-2025-41244).

  The vulnerable behavior involves the VMware tools service or its discovery scripts
  executing other programs to probe their version

  strings. An attacker can place a malicious program in a writable location (for example
  /tmp) and have the tools execute it with

  elevated privileges, resulting in local privilege escalation. The rule flags launches
  where vmtoolsd or the service discovery

  scripts start other child processes.'
