title: Potential Successful Linux RDP Brute Force Attack Detected
id: 521fbe5c-a78d-4b6b-a323-f978b0e4c4c0
status: stable
level: medium
description: 'An RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) brute force attack involves an attacker
  repeatedly attempting various username and

  password combinations to gain unauthorized access to a remote computer via RDP,
  and if successful, the potential impact

  can include unauthorized control over the compromised system, data theft, or the
  ability to launch further attacks

  within the network, jeopardizing the security and confidentiality of the targeted
  system and potentially compromising

  the entire network infrastructure. This rule identifies multiple consecutive authentication
  failures targeting a

  specific user account within a short time interval, followed by a successful authentication.'
