title: AWS RDS Snapshot Deleted

status: stable
level: medium
description: Identifies the deletion of an AWS RDS DB snapshot. Snapshots contain
  a full backup of an entire DB instance. Unauthorized deletion of snapshots can make
  it impossible to recover critical or sensitive data. This rule detects deleted snapshots
  and instances modified so that backupRetentionPeriod is set to 0 which disables
  automated backups and is functionally similar to deleting the system snapshot.
