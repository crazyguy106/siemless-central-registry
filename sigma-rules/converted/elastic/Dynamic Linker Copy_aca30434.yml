description: 'Detects the copying of the Linux dynamic loader binary and subsequent
  file creation for the purpose of creating a backup

  copy. This technique was seen recently being utilized by Linux malware prior to
  patching the dynamic loader in order to

  inject and preload a malicious shared object file. This activity should never occur
  and if it does then it should be

  considered highly suspicious or malicious.'
