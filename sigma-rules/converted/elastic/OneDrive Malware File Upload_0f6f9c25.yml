description: 'Identifies the occurence of files uploaded to OneDrive being detected
  as Malware by the file scanning engine. Attackers

  can use File Sharing and Organization Repositories to spread laterally within the
  company and amplify their access.

  Users can inadvertently share these files without knowing their maliciousness, giving
  adversaries opportunity to gain
