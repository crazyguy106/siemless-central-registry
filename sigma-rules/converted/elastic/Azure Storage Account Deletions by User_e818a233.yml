title: Azure Storage Account Deletions by User
id: b2c3d4e5-6f7a-8b9c-0d1e-2f3a4b5c6d7e
status: stable
level: high
description: 'Identifies when a single user or service principal deletes multiple
  Azure Storage Accounts within a short time period.

  This behavior may indicate an adversary attempting to cause widespread service disruption,
  destroy evidence, or execute

  a destructive attack such as ransomware. Mass deletion of storage accounts can have
  severe business impact and is rarely

  performed by legitimate administrators except during controlled decommissioning
  activities.'
