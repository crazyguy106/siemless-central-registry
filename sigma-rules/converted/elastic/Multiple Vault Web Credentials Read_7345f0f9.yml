description: 'Windows Credential Manager allows you to create, view, or delete saved
  credentials for signing into websites, connected

  applications, and networks. An adversary may abuse this to list or dump credentials
  stored in the Credential Manager for

  saved usernames and passwords. This may also be performed in preparation of lateral
  movement.'
