title: AWS IAM Deactivation of MFA Device
id: d8fc1cca-93ed-43c1-bbb6-c0dd3eff2958
status: stable
level: medium
description: 'Detects the deactivation of a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device
  in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). MFA

  provides critical protection against unauthorized access by requiring a second factor
  for authentication. Adversaries or

  compromised administrators may deactivate MFA devices to weaken account protections,
  disable strong authentication, or

  prepare for privilege escalation or persistence. This rule monitors successful DeactivateMFADevice
  API calls, which

  represent the point at which MFA protection is actually removed.'

falsepositives:
- "    MFA device deactivation may occur legitimately during device rotation, user\
  \ offboarding, or troubleshooting. For\n    example, AWS requires deactivation of\
  \ an existing MFA device before adding a replacement. These actions are often\n\
  \    performed by administrators following approved change-control processes. To\
  \ reduce false positives, validate whether\n    the deactivation aligns with a documented\
  \ workflow, known device replacement, or expected maintenance window. If\n    performed\
  \ outside of expected operational hours, by an unexpected user, or from an unfamiliar\
  \ source IP, this event\n    should be investigated for potential credential compromise\
  \ or unauthorized tampering.\n    "
