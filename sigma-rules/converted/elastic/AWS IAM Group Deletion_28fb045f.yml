description: 'Detects when an IAM group is deleted using the DeleteGroup API call.
  Deletion of an IAM group may represent a malicious

  attempt to remove audit trails, disrupt operations, or hide adversary activity (for
  example after using the group

  briefly for privileged access). This can be an indicator of impact or cleanup in
  an attack lifecycle.'
