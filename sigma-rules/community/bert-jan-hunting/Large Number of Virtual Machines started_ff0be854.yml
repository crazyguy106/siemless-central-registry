title: Large Number of Virtual Machines started
id: e52a3d10-e395-4e5d-b501-611ee52b97e8
status: experimental
level: medium
description: |
  This query detects when a Large Number of Virtual Machines is started within a short timeframe. The query uses two inputs; Threshold and TimeFrame. The threshold determines the number of machines from when the query should output results. The timeframe determines how long the period is to reach the threshold.

The total numbers are calculated based on resourcegroup level.
