title: Detect Executable Files in C:\Users\Public*

  This query detects rare Executable files that are created in the folder C:\Users\Public and all the subfolders. It is not common that executable files are created in this folder and therefore the file creations should be investigated. An attacker can use those folders to 

Note: The query for Sentinel is different then the one for MDE, this is because the FileProfile function is used, which is currently not supported by Sentinel. Therefore I suggest running this query in MDE for the best results.
