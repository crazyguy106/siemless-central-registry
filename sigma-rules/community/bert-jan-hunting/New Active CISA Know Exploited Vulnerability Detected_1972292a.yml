title: New Active CISA Know Exploited Vulnerability Detected
id: e72b7849-7cea-40b5-9747-b51dac01829b
status: experimental
level: medium
description: |
  CISA provides a comprehensive list of known exploited vulnerabilities with CVE numbers, vendor names, product names, vulnerability names, dates, short descriptions, action due dates, and notes. This dynamic list is ingested into a KQL query to detect newly added known exploited vulnerabilities that are active in your environment.

  You can implement this query below as a custom detection rule to notify you about newly added vulnerabilities, I would suggest running this a few times every day to be on top of the added vulnerabilities. The *NewThreshold* variable defines how new a vulnerbility must be, the default is set to one day.
