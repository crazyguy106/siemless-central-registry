status: experimental
level: medium
description: |
  CISA, the NSA, and the FBI, Five Eyes cybersecurity authorities have listed the vulnerabilities that have been most exploited in 2022. The query below lists all those vulnerabilities in order to be able to prioritize patching. These vulnerabilities should be patched as soon as possible to prevent breaches, if they have not already occurred. If one of those vulnerabilities is connected to the public internet, assume that the device has been compromised. 

You can add more CVE's to the current list based on the Additional Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities listed in the CISA report in the references.

If you want to alert on this vulnerability the last lines need to be changed to the lines below. This is in order to meet the custom detection rule requirements, which are the Timestamp and reportId.
