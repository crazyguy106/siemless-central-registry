description: |
  The following analytic detects the execution of odbcconf.exe with the regsvr action to load a DLL. This is identified by monitoring command-line arguments in process creation logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code via DLL loading, a common technique used in various attack vectors. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the odbcconf.exe process
