description: |
  The following analytic detects instances where a shell is spawned within a Kubernetes container. Leveraging Falco, a cloud-native runtime security tool, this analytic monitors system calls within the Kubernetes environment and flags when a shell is spawned. This activity is significant for a SOC as it may indicate unauthorized access, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate container processes, or escalate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breache
