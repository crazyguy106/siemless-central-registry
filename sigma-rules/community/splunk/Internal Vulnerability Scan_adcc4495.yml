title: Internal Vulnerability Scan
id: 5e890e0f-cb93-57fe-8ff5-e92c40d3135f
status: experimental
level: high
description: |
  This analytic detects internal hosts triggering multiple IDS signatures, which may include either more than 25 signatures against a single host or a single signature across over 25 destination IP addresses. Such patterns can indicate active vulnerability scanning activities within the network. By monitoring IDS logs, this detection helps identify and respond to potential vulnerability scanning attempts, enhancing the network's security posture and preventing potential exploits.
