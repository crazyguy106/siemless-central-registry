  The following analytic detects file downloads that were classified as malware by Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense. It relies on the `SHA_Disposition` field with a value of "Malware" and includes metadata such as file name, file_hash hash, and threat classification. This analytic is critical for surfacing file-based threats that are identified via Cisco's AMP or Threat Grid integrations. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate delivery of malware.
