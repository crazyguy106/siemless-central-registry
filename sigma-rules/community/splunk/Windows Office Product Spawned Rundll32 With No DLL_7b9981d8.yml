description: |
  The following analytic detects any Windows Office Product spawning `rundll32.exe` without a `.dll` file extension. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process and parent process relationships. This activity is significant as it is a known tactic of the IcedID malware family, which can lead to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data exfiltration
